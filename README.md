# Internship Task - API Endpoint

This repository contains a  solution for an HNG Backend  task one. The objective of the task was to create and host an API endpoint that takes two GET request query parameters: `slack_name` and `track`. The API should return specific information in JSON format, including Slack name, current day of the week, current UTC time, track, GitHub file URL, GitHub repo URL, and a success status code.

I successfully created the API, adhered to the specified JSON format, and ensured that it meets the acceptance criteria.  The is solution is hosted at [Not yet ](link-to-your-api-endpoint), and the code can be found in this repository.
